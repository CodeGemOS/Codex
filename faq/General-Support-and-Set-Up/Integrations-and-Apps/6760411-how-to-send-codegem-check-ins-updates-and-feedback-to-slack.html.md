    **Note: **The CodeGem Slackbot works best with public channels. ***If you want to use the CodeGem Slackbot in a private channel,****** you will have to add the CodeGem Slackbot to the private channel.***\
    \
    You can do that by typing the following in the private channel:

    ```
          /invite @codegem
         
    ```
