5.  Since CodeGem does not currently support multiple organization accounts you will need to create a new organization.

6.  To use the same email address add a plus "+" sign followed by characters/words. Example: your email address is " [steph@codegem.app ](mailto:steph@codegem.app)", you would enter “steph **+admin** @codegem.app”.

7.  Choose a password and click "continue with email":
