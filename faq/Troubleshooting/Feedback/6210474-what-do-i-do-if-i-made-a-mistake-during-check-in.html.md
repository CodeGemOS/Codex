# What Do I Do if I Made a Mistake During Check-In?

If you accidentally choose the wrong mood color you can simply hover over the blue tab and check-in again and we'll take the average of your two check-ins.

1.  Hover over the blue tab on the right-hand side of your browser.

2.  Check-in again by choosing a color that best describes how you're feeling. The darkest green represents a very positive mood while the darkest red represents a very negative mood.
