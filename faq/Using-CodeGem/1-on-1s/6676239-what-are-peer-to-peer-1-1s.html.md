# What Are Peer to Peer 1:1s?

Peer to Peer 1:1s are meetings between individuals on different teams at the same level. They help develop cross functional relationships between teams. They allow for the sharing of information and ideas and they help to drive company alignment. Peer to peer 1:1s are a great way to understand the role of others and how everyone works together.

We recommend meeting with peers that you work with often or in roles where there is some overlap. Example: a Product Manager and an Engineer Team Lead, a Sales Manager and Manager of Customer Success or Marketing and Sales managers.
