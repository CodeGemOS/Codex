# What Is a Skip Level Meeting?

Skip level meetings are 1:1s that managers hold with staff other than the people they manage directly - usually they are between a senior manager and the direct reports of the people they manage.

They’re a great way to improve communication and the flow of information within a company. Managers get a sense of what is happening on the front lines and employees get a better sense of larger company objectives. It is a great opportunity for managers to build trust with employees and ensure that they’re feeling engaged and valued.
