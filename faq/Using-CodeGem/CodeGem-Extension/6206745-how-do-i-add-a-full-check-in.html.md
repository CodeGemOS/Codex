# How Do I Add a Full Check-In?

Full check-ins are done through the [CodeGem Extension ](6198282-how-to-install-the-codegem-chrome-extension.html).

[Quick check-ins ](https://app.intercom.com/a/apps/io0un5jj/articles/articles/6198554/)are great for quickly gauging how you feel each day. If you have an additional minute or two, consider adding a full check-in. Everything in a full check-in is ***completely optional*** and meant to add context and help your manager and team understand how you're doing and how they can support you.

You can:

1.  Add emojis

2.  Share some additional details

3.  Tag team members

4.  Tags things like "communication, process, environment, etc"
