# How to Use CodeGem to Run Async Standups

Standups are a daily meeting usually held first thing in the morning. They're meant to quickly go over what everyone is working on, what progress has been made and to surface any obstacles or blockers.

Many teams use the [CodeGem extension ](6198282-how-to-install-the-codegem-chrome-extension.html)along with the [CodeGem Slackbot ](6753485-how-to-install-the-codegem-slackbot.html)to run asynchronous standups which help save engineering hours (by some estimates this adds up to $45,000 a year!).

# How to run Async Standup

1.  Managers should inform the team of the switch to a new async standup format.
2.  Each team member should ensure they have downloaded the CodeGem extension. Chrome [link ](6198282-how-to-install-the-codegem-chrome-extension.html). Brave [link ](6770510-how-to-install-the-codegem-extension-on-brave-browser.html). Firefox and other browsers [link ](6278139-how-to-install-the-build-file-for-the-codegem-extension.html).
3.  Perform a [check-in ](6206745-how-do-i-add-a-full-wellness-check-in.html)each morning with your preferred standup format (we've included some templates below).
4.  *Optional but recommended -* [Integrate with Slack ](6753485-how-to-install-the-codegem-slackbot.html)so that all standup updates are sent to a Slack channel of your choice so the entire team can view and reply to them.
