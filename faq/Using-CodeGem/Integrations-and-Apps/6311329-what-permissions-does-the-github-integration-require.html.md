**Who can see what data and at what level? There are two views:**

1.  **Admin View:** Includes team-level analytics and the ability to drill down into the individual level
2.  **Individual View:** Only able to access their individual analytics (we are exploring shared team dashboards that individuals would be able to access).

**Do you have access to our source code?**

Connecting to GitHub pulls only the metadata and a team list from your GitHub organization. This provides CodeGem with the necessary information to generate analytics. We do not store source code.
