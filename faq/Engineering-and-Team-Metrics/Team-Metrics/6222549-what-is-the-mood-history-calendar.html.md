The Mood History Calendar gives the average mood of your team for the day. Clicking on a specific day will show the actual responses used to aggregate the data. The calendar helps to identify trends - which days tend to generate positive or negative moods? If a particular day of the week consistently gives your team a more negative mood, perhaps an activity rescheduling can take place in a way that uplift moods. This information can also serve as a useful input for retrospectives.
