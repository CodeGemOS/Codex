# What is the "Feedback Received" chart?

The "Feedback Received" chart can be found by clicking "analytics" and scrolling down to the bottom of the "KPI" page.

The "Feedback Received" chart helps managers understand if the team is sharing and receiving a desired amount of feedback per week. By default CodeGem has set the desired amount of feedback set to 1 piece of feedback per week per team member.

Continuous feedback is important because it supports change, fuels growth, boosts engagement and builds stronger teams. To build an effective culture of feedback, it's important to ensure that feedback is shared frequently.
