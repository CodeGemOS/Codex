# What is the Daily Wellness Score?

The Daily Wellness Score is an average of the daily mood across your entire team. This score ranges from -2 meaning very negative, to 2 meaning very positive.

This information is displayed in a Daily Wellness Score chart. Fluctuations in both directions can help us understand what is going well and what we can do better. Please note that this is not an ENPS score to be optimized. We expect team members to have bad days, a consistently high score may point to a lack of psychological safety.
