# What is the Average Review Time Breakdown?

## What is it?

The Average Review Time Breakdown metric shows the average time a code reviewer takes to pickup the pull request (from the time the pull request is issued), as well as the time to close/merge the pull request.

## Why does it matter?

This is a productivity indicator that gives engineering managers insight into how efficiently a team operates. If the time to merge is relatively long, you may want to rethink your team's methodology to identify possible bottlenecks. If the time to merge is too short, this may be indicative of pull requests being merged without sufficient review so your code quality may suffer as a result. Time to merge should be balanced with code quality.

## **How to use**

This is a productivity indicator that gives insight into how efficiently the team operates. **Pickup time **should be as low as possible.**** If pickup times are longer than 1 day, this is worrisome. Longer pickup times could mean that there isn't enough visibility on the pull request (i.e. developers are unaware that the PR exists), team members are occupied with other pressing tasks or the PR is too large in size.

If the **time to merge** is relatively long, you may want to rethink your team's methodology to identify any bottlenecks. If the time to merge is too short, this may be indicative of PRs being merged without sufficient reviewing, so code quality might be suffer. Time to merge should be balanced with quality.

## **Where to find this metric**

The Average Review Time Breakdown metric can be found by clicking "Analytics" in the left-hand navigation menu and in the "Github" submenu. This metric is best used when you have already [integrated CodeGem with Github ](6213899-how-to-integrate-with-github.html).
