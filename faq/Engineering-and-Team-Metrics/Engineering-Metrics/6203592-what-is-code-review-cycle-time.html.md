# What is Code Review Cycle Time?

## **What is Code Review Cycle Time?**

Code Review Cycle Time is the time between pick-up to the time it is merged back into the main branch. It represents your team's code review velocity, or how quickly software is moved through the review phase and delivered to your customers. A lower Code Review Cycle Time often equates to effective prioritization of code review and more efficient teams

This information is displayed in a Code Review Cycle Time chart which by default displays the team's average.

## **Why does it matter?**

Code Review Cycle Time represents your team‚Äôs code review velocity, or how quickly software is moved through the review phase and delivered to your customers. A lower Code Review Cycle Time often equates to effective prioritization of code review and more efficient teams. It is also correlated with higher stability, giving your team the ability to quickly respond to issues with change.

This is a success metric that you can use across individuals, teams, or cohorts to make certain that code review does not become a bottleneck in your delivery process.

## How to use it?

Use it to understand you team's baseline review speed. Then you can check any major changes in process against this to make sure it had a positive or negative effect on review speed.

Teams should aim for shorter Code Review Cycle Times. If the average time is greater than 2.5 days, this would be a metric that you would want to improve.
