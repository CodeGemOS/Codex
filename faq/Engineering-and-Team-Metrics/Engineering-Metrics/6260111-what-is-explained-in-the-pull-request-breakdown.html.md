# What is Explained in the Pull Request Breakdown?

## What is it?

The Pull Request Breakdown includes information on how many pull requests are open, merged and closed.

## Why does it matter?

The pull request breakdown gives engineering managers insight into how the team is devoting their time to PRs.

## How to use it

Most teams aim for an open to closed ratio of 1:1 (visually this would mean the blue area is equal to green + red areas). The closer to this ratio you are, the more predictable your team's flow is. Engineering managers shouldn't use pull request data to assess individual performance, they should use it to understand how the team works together.

The pull request breakdown works best if you have [integrated CodeGem with GitHub ](6213899-how-to-integrate-with-github.html). You can find this analytic by clicking "Analytics" in the left-hand navigation menu, then choosing "Github" in the submenu.
