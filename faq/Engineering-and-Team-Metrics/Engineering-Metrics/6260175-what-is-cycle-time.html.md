# What is Cycle Time

## What is it?

The Average Cycle time is the average time from **first commit **to** pull request merged.**

## Why does it matter?

Cycle Time helps us understand an engineering team's speed and tempo. It gives a picture of how quickly a team is able to complete work.

Teams with shorter cycles are able to experiment quicker and be more agile to changing business needs. Generally, a shorter cycle time indicates more efficient processes within a team.

## How to use it?

Cycle time can be used to assess the operations and tools used within your software development team. It gives you insight into the critical parts of the product delivery process that are directly under the control of the engineering team (e.g. code review tools, automated tests, deployment scripts).

When cycle times exceed healthy thresholds, it is likely due to bottlenecks in workflow, constraints like technical debt, team burnout, context switching or poor software engineering processes.

## Health score

The best teams aim for an average cycle time of <1.8 days. The average is around 5 days.

## Where can I find this metric?

The "Average Cycle Time (As PR Author" metric can be found by clicking "Analytics" in the left-hand navigation menu and in the "Github" submenu. It works best if your team has [integrated CodeGem with Github ](6213899-how-to-integrate-with-github.html).
