# What is the Average Cycle Time Breakdown?

## What is it?

The "Average Cycle Time Breakdown" metric is a breakdown of the processes that make up your average cycle time. This includes: request, pickup and time to merge.

## Why does it matter?

This metric helps engineering managers understand where the bottlenecks may be occurring and work towards flow efficiency and reduce delivery times.

## How do I use it?

**Request: **This measures how long it takes from the creation of a pull request to when it is picked up for review.\
\
When there is a long delay between pull request creation and review, it is frustrating for developers and engineering managers. The best teams have a pick up time (time between request and pickup) of \~ 7 hours. Teams that need to work on this bottleneck often see times \~20 hours.

## What can you do about slow pick up times?

*   Ensure the team knows that the pull request has been created
*   Ensure there is a team and process in place to do code reviews
*   Reduce PR size

**Pickup: **This measures how long it takes from when a team member picks up a pull request to review to when it is ready to merge.

|    |             |                     |
| -- | ----------- | ------------------- |
|    | Review Time | Industry Benchmarks |
| ðŸŸ¢ | < 6 hours   | Top 25%             |
| ðŸŸ¡ | \~ 13 hours | Average             |
| ðŸ”´ | \~ 30 hours | Bottom 25%          |

## What can you do about high review times?

*   Reduce the PR size
*   Decrease the amount of work in progress the team has so they have time to do code review
*   Assign a team or group of developers to perform code reviews

**Time To Close/Merge: **This measures how long it takes from when a PR has been reviewed and approved to when the PR is merged.

## What can you do to improve time to close/merge?

*   Improve testing
*   Reduce PR size, less chance of bugs

## Where can I find this metric?

The "Average Cycle Time Breakdown" metric can be found by clicking "Analytics" in the left-hand navigation menu and in the "Github" submenu. This metric is best used when you have [integrated CodeGem with Github ](6213899-how-to-integrate-with-github.html).
