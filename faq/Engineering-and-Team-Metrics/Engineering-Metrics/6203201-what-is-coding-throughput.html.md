# What is Coding Throughput?

## **What is it?**

Coding throughput is a measurement of pull requests merged during a specific period. It is similar to sprint velocity. It gives you a picture of how much engineering work your team can typically accomplish during a given period.

## Why does it matter?

A consistent throughput indicates a sustainable work pace. A drop in throughput can indicate bottlenecks, big PRs or a lack of coding time. A spike in throughput can indicate burnout.

## How to use it?

Throughput should be optimized based on how your team collaborates. If your team tends to leverage pair-programming, drawing insights from individual throughputs may not be practical. Throughput should be compared against other metrics in order to accurately evaluate the composition of your team.

| -- | ---------- | ------------------- |
|    | PRs Merged | Industry Benchmarks |
| ðŸŸ¢ | 5 or more  | Top 25%             |
| ðŸŸ¡ | 3 to 5     | Average             |
| ðŸ”´ | 0 to 3     | Bottom 25%          |

## **Where can I find this metric?**

The "Coding Throughput" analytic shows the number of pull requests merged during a specified period. It can be found in the "Analytics" section in the left-hand navigation menu of your CodeGem Dashboard.
