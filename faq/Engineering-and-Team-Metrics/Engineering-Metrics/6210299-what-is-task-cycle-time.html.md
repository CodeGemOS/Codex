# What is Task Cycle Time?

## What is it?

Task Cycle Time is the total time from when a task is first moved to a status of "in progress", "started" or "in development" to when it is resolved. It helps you understand how long tasks (stories, bugs, tasks, etc.) take from start to completion.

## Why does it matter?

Task Cycle Time helps teams understand baseline productivity over time.

## **How to use it**

Task Cycle Time can be viewed along with Pull Request Cycle Time. Use it to understand baseline productivity over time, and to check for any changes in the teamâ€™s process that caused a positive or negative effect on this metric.

If Task Cycle Time is high it could mean that your developers have a lot of Work In Progress, that requirements are unclear, task scope is too large, or that the QA process is taking too long.

This metric is not diagnostic, so to identify why Task Cycle Time is high, youâ€™ll want to look at other metrics that make up the software development process, such as Time to Open, Time to Review, Time to Merge, or review cycles.

## Health Score

In general, teams should aim for shorter Task Cycle Times.
