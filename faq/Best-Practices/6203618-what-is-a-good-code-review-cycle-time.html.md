# What is a Good Code Review Cycle Time?

Generally, a development team wants a solid review, one that is neither too long nor too short. A quality team will try to keep Code Cycle Review Time **between one and two days **. Keeping your teamâ€™s code cycle review time within the proper boundaries is crucial to keeping quality code moving through the development pipeline.

Teams should aim for shorter Code Review Cycle Times. If the average time is greater than 5 days, this would be a metric that you would want to improve.

âœ… **1.8 days or less: **Top 25%

ðŸš§ **1.8 to 2 days: **Average

ðŸš¨ **6.2 days or higher: **Bottom 25%

Code Review Cycle Time represents your teamâ€™s code review velocity, or how quickly software is moved through the review phase and delivered to your customers. A lower Code Review Cycle Time often equates to effective prioritization of code review and more efficient teams.

## **How can we improve our Code Review Cycle Time?**

1.  **Make sure your pull request size isnâ€™t too big. **Developers should review no more than 200 to 400 lines of code (LOC) at a time. Beyond 400 lines of code, the ability to find defects diminishes.
2.  **Donâ€™t let reviews sit and be forgotten.**
3.  **Make sure that completed reviews are merged immediately. **Sometimes completed reviews have just not been merged back into the main branch.
4.  **Monitor reviews. **If you find that your teamâ€™s review time is too short, look into whether pull requests are getting approved with too little or no comments.
5.  **Reduce your teamâ€™s workload. **You can review whether your team has too much work to do and is feeling the crunch of too much Work in Progress (WIP).
