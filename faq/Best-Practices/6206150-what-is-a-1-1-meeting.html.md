# What is a 1:1 meeting?

Your 1:1 is a dedicated time for an open-ended conversation with your manager. It's a space for coaching, mentorship or questions. These meetings are also the space where you should feel confident giving your manager genuine feedback and having tough conversations.

**What should I discuss on my 1:1?**

*   **Praise** . Recognize what you, your manager, your team, and your company are doing well.
*   **Feedback** . Feedback is a critical stage in transformation. If you wish to see changes in your workplace, you have to be willing to bring up potentially sensitive topics. Asking for or giving feedback about yourself, your manager, your team and/or your company will help transform your work situation for the better.
*   **Expectations** . Understand what success looks like for both you and your manager.
*   **Goal Setting** . Once you identify areas that can be improved, set goals and check-in on those goals regularly.
