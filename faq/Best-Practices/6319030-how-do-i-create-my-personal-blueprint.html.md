# How Do I Create My Personal Blueprint?

# ❌ “Treat others how you like to be treated”

# ✅ "Treat others how **they** like to be treated”

Communication, like network protocols, is how we as humans transmit our mental state to another human. Unfortunately, unlike modern network protocols, human communication is highly lossful, which is why the term **miscommunication** is cited so commonly as the source of conflict.

You use words, expressions, body language, emojis, tone, visuals, etc... to try to transmit what's going on in your head. But often there's an underlying assumption that the way we learn and understand is the same as others.

You wouldn't use Slack's API docs to try to use Github's API. We need to read our teammate's API docs to make sure we're sending the data over in the right format for their processor. Your blueprint is your API doc; it's a guide your team will use to better understand, support, and collaborate with you.

You hate working with tools with crappy docs, so... 😉

Remember, these blueprints are designed to be iterative. Like everything in CodeGem our goal is to continuously improve.

Some "Guidelines" to building your blueprint...

1.  **Do not fill in any section you are not comfortable with. **That said, if you feel uncomfortable sharing something with your team, this can be a sign that (as a team)** psychological safety must be improved.**\
    *Reflect on, why does this make you uncomfortable? What are you afraid of? To help your manager improve your team's environment, note down these thoughts by completing a check-in and/or sharing feedback.*
2.  **Your teammates will be reading this. **Unlike feedback (which should always be shared from the "I" perspective) use "you". i.e. "I want *you* to do this".
3.  Managers should also fill in the "how to manage me" section!
4.  Blueprints are living. Just as you are ever-changing and growing, so is this blueprint. It will never be perfect, but each 1 on 1 acts as a small step to improving it.
5.  As you're completing your blueprint, think about your team! For each prompt, can you guess what your team member will put?
