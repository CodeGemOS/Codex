## Be an Effective Listener During 1:1s

*   **Overcome distractions** . Make a commitment to listen even when it is difficult and reduce any distractions for yourself. You should take responsibility for concentrating on what a meeting provides.
*   **Focus on central themes** . As you take notes, imagine that you must summarize the information you record to others after the meeting. This will force you to decide on essential information. Preparing beforehand with 1:1 templates helps you to take in and organize new information.
*   **Maintain your focus** . When your mind wanders, refocus. Bring your attention back to what you hear. If you feel confused or lose interest, ask a question for clarification or leave a question mark in your private notes. You can discuss the point later.
*   **Judge the message, not the messenger** . Not all team members are excellent communicators, but the information that they are sharing is still valuable. Focus on what you are hearing, not how it is being communicated. Be determined to learn someting from every meeting
