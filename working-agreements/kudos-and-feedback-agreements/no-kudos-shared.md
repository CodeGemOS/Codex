# ðŸŒŸ No Kudos Shared

### **Why?**

Activating this Team Norm will increase morale, cohesion, and a more positive work environment. **How?** Because positive feedback and recognition for work is a huge contributors to one's motivation, job satisfaction, and overall well-being. By setting a minimum standard for kudos, you ensure that everyone on the team is appreciated and valued for their contributions, irrelevant to one skill being more or less than another.

Monitoring the sharing of kudos within a team is crucial for several reasons:

2. **Reinforces Positive Behavior:** Kudos act as positive reinforcement, encouraging the continuation of desirable behaviours. It aids in setting a precedent for the work level valued and recognized within the team or organization.
3. **Improves Team Culture:** Kudos sharing promotes a positive and supportive work culture where employees feel their contributions are recognized. This can lead to enhanced team cohesion, collaboration, and overall satisfaction.
4. **Promotes Transparency and Communication:** The practice of giving kudos can help foster openness and improve communication within the team. It allows team members to express gratitude and acknowledge each other's efforts, strengthening interpersonal relationships.
5. **Aids in Performance Management:** Kudos can act as an informal performance management tool, providing insights into individual contributions and achievements. This can assist managers in tracking performance, identifying strengths, and guiding professional development plans.

By monitoring the sharing of kudos, managers can ensure these benefits are realized, address any issues (like a lack of recognition), and continuously promote a positive, supportive work environment.
