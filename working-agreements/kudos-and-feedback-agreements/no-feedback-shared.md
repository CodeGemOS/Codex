# ðŸŒ± No Feedback Shared

### **Why?**

Activating this Team Norm will increase morale, improve team cohesion, and create a more positive work environment. **How?** Because positive feedback and recognition for work greatly contribute to motivation, job satisfaction, and overall well-being. By setting a minimum standard for kudos, you ensure that everyone on the team is appreciated and valued for their contributions, irrelevant to one skill being more or less than another.&#x20;

Monitoring the amount of feedback shared within a team is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Learning and Development**: Feedback is vital for individual growth and skill development. It helps identify areas of strength and potential areas for improvement.
2. **Quality of Work**: Constructive feedback can greatly improve the quality of work produced by the team. It promotes learning from mistakes, correcting them, and preventing their recurrence.
3. **Efficiency and Innovation**: Regular feedback can foster a culture of continuous improvement, leading to more efficient processes and innovative ideas.
4. **Team Collaboration**: Sharing feedback can improve communication within the team, leading to better collaboration and understanding.
5. **Employee Engagement and Satisfaction**: When employees receive regular feedback (both positive and constructive), they feel more engaged and appreciated. It also helps promptly address issues or concerns, contributing to job satisfaction.
6. **Transparency**: Regular feedback fosters an environment of transparency, where everyone knows where they stand and what's expected of them.
7. **Accountability**: Feedback promotes accountability by informing everyone about their performance and areas where they must step up.
8. **Decision Making**: Feedback can aid in informed decision-making, especially from different perspectives. It provides a broader view of the situation or problem at hand.

Therefore, by monitoring and promoting feedback sharing, leaders can create a healthier, more open, and more productive work environment, contributing to the team's overall success.

### **Recommendations**

If team members do not share enough kudos, they may need to improve their recognition and appreciation culture. This can be achieved by encouraging frequent public kudos, providing training on effective kudos, and adding space for recognition in 1:1s and team meetings. Additionally, leveraging a comprehensive feedback tool like CodeGem can greatly enhance the process of sharing kudos within the team.&#x20;

CodeGem provides a user-friendly interface to facilitate recognition and appreciation, making it easy for team members to give and receive kudos seamlessly. With features such as real-time notifications, feedback tracking, and analytics, CodeGem can enhance the visibility and impact of kudos within the team.

Here we outline the potential causes of infrequent feedback sharing on a team, their corresponding indicators, and possible solutions, along with the recommendation to leverage CodeGem for effective kudos sharing.

#### **Fear of Conflict**

Team members might avoid giving feedback for fear of causing disagreement or conflict, especially if the feedback is constructive or negative.

**Signs**:

1. Team members avoid sensitive topics.
2. Excessive agreement during discussions without proper exploration of the topic.
3. Ignoring or downplaying performance issues instead of addressing them directly.

**Recommendations**:

1. Encourage a culture that values openness and honesty, ensuring team members understand that constructive conflict is necessary and beneficial for team growth.
2. Facilitate team-building activities to foster camaraderie and improve communication.
3. Train team members on conflict resolution skills.
4. Establish a conflict escalation process so team members know how to proceed when conflicts arise.

#### &#x20;**Lack of Trust**

Without a strong foundation of trust, team members might not feel safe or comfortable giving or receiving feedback.

**Signs**:

1. Hesitation to share opinions or ideas during meetings.
2. Team members withhold information or resources.
3. Lack of collaboration and team unity.

**Recommendations**:

1. Build trust by promoting transparency in communication and decision-making processes.

4. Reinforce shared goals and collective responsibility, fostering a sense of belonging and unity.

#### **Culture and Norms**

If the team culture does not encourage feedback or is not standard practice, feedback sharing might be minimal.

**Signs**:

1. Absence of regular feedback sessions.

#### **Lack of Skills**

Some people might not know how to give effective feedback or be uncomfortable doing so.

**Signs**:

1. Feedback provided is vague, non-specific, or ineffective.
2. Individuals avoid giving feedback, especially when it's constructive or negative.

#### **Lack of Time**

In fast-paced environments, team members might lack time to give or solicit feedback.

**Signs**:

1. Meetings are rushed, with little or no time for feedback or discussions.
2. Deadlines are frequently missed, indicating overworked team members.

4. Encourage the use of tools and software, such as CodeGem, that streamline processes and increase efficiency.

#### &#x20;**No Clear Process**

If there is no clear process or system for feedback sharing, team members might not know when or how to give feedback.

**Signs**:

1. Confusion about when or how to provide feedback.
2. Feedback is rarely given or received or only provided during formal reviews.
3. Team members express frustration or dissatisfaction with the feedback process.

**Recommendations**:

2. Use CodeGem to simplify the process and keep track of feedback given and received.
3. Regularly review and improve the feedback process based on team members' experiences and feedback.

2. Provide resources and materials on effective feedback strategies.
3. Include feedback training in onboarding processes for new team members.
4. Role-play or simulation exercises allow team members to practice giving and receiving feedback.

#### **Lack of Management Support**

If leaders or managers do not model and encourage feedback, team members might be less likely to give it.

**Signs**:

1. Leaders rarely give or ask for feedback.
2. Feedback is not recognized or rewarded by leadership.
3. Managers do not support team members in improving based on feedback received.

**Recommendations**:

1. Leaders should model the desired behaviour by giving and receiving feedback regularly.

**Conclusion**: Feedback is the lifeblood of agile teams, crucial for continuous improvement and team effectiveness. Overcoming barriers to feedback sharing requires understanding the underlying causes, recognizing the signs, and applying effective strategies to address them. Fostering a feedback-rich culture goes beyond implementing processesâ€”it's about developing a mindset that values learning, openness, and mutual respect.
