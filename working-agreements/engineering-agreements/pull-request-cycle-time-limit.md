# ‚è∞ Pull Request Cycle Time Limit

## Why?

Monitoring development PR (Pull Request) cycle time is important for several reasons, which ultimately contribute to a software development team's efficiency, productivity, and overall success. Here are some key reasons why it's essential to keep an eye on PR cycle time:

1. Faster feedback loops: Shorter PR cycle times mean developers receive feedback on their code more quickly. Timely feedback allows developers to address issues, fix bugs, and improve more efficiently, leading to higher-quality code.
2. Early identification of bottlenecks: Monitoring PR cycle times can help identify bottlenecks in the development process. By spotting areas causing delays, teams can take proactive steps to address these issues and streamline the development process.
3. Improved collaboration: A shorter PR cycle time can foster better collaboration among team members. When PRs are reviewed and merged promptly, it encourages more active communication and teamwork, leading to a more cohesive and efficient team.
4. Increased productivity: Reducing PR cycle time can boost overall team productivity by minimizing delays and ensuring developers can move on to new tasks more quickly. This can help maintain momentum and prevent developers from waiting for feedback or approval.
5. Predictable delivery schedules: Keeping PR cycle times consistent and short can make it easier to estimate delivery timelines, allowing for better planning and resource allocation.
6. Enhanced customer satisfaction: By reducing PR cycle times, teams can ship new features, improvements, and bug fixes to customers more quickly. This can increase customer satisfaction and a more positive perception of the product or service.

Monitoring and optimizing PR cycle times can lead to more efficient development processes, increased productivity, better collaboration, and improved customer satisfaction.

## Recommendations

Several factors can cause the PR (Pull Request) cycle time to exceed the agreed-upon limit in a development team. Identifying the signs of these causes is crucial, and implementing solutions accordingly. Below, we outline the potential causes of extended PR cycle times, their corresponding indicators, and possible solutions.

### Insufficient resources&#x20;

An inefficient or unclear review process can delay PR cycle time. This may involve a lack of guidelines, too many reviewers, or inadequate communication among team members.

#### Signs

* Team members consistently report being overworked or overwhelmed.
* Deadlines are frequently missed, and tasks are often delayed.
* Frequent complaints about the unavailability of reviewers.

#### Recommendations

* Implement a rotation system for PR review responsibilities to balance workload evenly.
* If there aren't enough team members to review PRs promptly, the cycle time may increase. This could be due to understaffing, high workload, or team members being tied up with other tasks.
* Hire additional team members or redistribute workload to ensure adequate coverage for PR reviews. Encourage cross-training to enable team members to review a broader range of PRs.

### Inadequate Review Process

An inefficient or unclear review process can delay PR cycle time. This may involve a lack of guidelines, too many reviewers, or inadequate communication among team members.

#### Signs

* Confusion or uncertainty about the PR review process among team members.
* Frequent back-and-forth communications during PR reviews.
* Inconsistent PR review quality or missed issues during the review process.

#### Recommendations

* to resolve questions or concerns during the review process quicklyEstablish clear guidelines for the PR review process, including expectations for turnaround time.&#x20;
* Streamline the review process by reducing the number of required reviewers and focusing on key decision-makers.
* Promote open communication channels to quickly resolve questions or concerns during the review process.

### Competing Priorities&#x20;

Team members may be preoccupied with other tasks or projects, causing PR reviews to take a backseat. As a result, cycle time may suffer as the team struggles to balance multiple priorities.

#### Signs

* Team members are regularly pulled away from PR reviews to work on other tasks.
* Frequent context-switching and multitasking among team members.
* Balancing multiple projects or tasks leads to delays and missed deadlines.

#### Recommendations

* Implement a prioritization system that helps team members identify the most critical tasks, including PR reviews.
* Encourage time management practices and allocate dedicated time for PR reviews.
* Regularly review team priorities and adjust as necessary to maintain a healthy balance.

### Large or Complex PRs

When PRs are large or involve complex changes, they may take longer to review and understand. This can extend the cycle time as reviewers need more time to assess the changes thoroughly.

#### Signs

* Regular submission of large PRs with numerous changes.
* Increased time spent on reviewing and understanding complex PRs.
* Frequent requests for clarification or more information during the review proces

#### Recommendations

* Encourage developers to break down large or complex changes into smaller, more manageable PRs.
* Implement a code review checklist to help reviewers focus on critical areas and reduce time spent on less important aspects.
* Provide adequate documentation and context for complex PRs to help reviewers understand the changes.

### Lack of Automation

Teams that do not utilize automation tools for tasks like code linting, testing, and integration checks may experience longer PR cycle times, as these tasks need to be done manually and can consume valuable time.&#x20;

#### Signs

* Manual execution of repetitive tasks such as code linting, testing, or integration checks.
* Missed issues during PR reviews that automated tools could have caught.
* Slow notification or assignment process for PR reviews.

#### Recommendations

* Integrate automation tools for code linting, testing, and integration checks to streamline the review process and reduce manual effort.
* Set up automatic notifications for PR reviewers to ensure they are informed of pending PRs.
* Utilize automated PR assignment systems to distribute PR reviews evenly among team members.

### Knowledge Gaps

If the PR involves a technology or area of the codebase that reviewers are unfamiliar with, it may take them longer to review the changes, leading to an increase in cycle time.

#### Signs

* Team members expressing uncertainty or lack of confidence in reviewing certain PRs.
* Inaccurate or incomplete reviews due to unfamiliarity with specific technologies or code areas.
* Reluctance to review PRs involving unfamiliar technologies or codebases.

#### Recommendations

* Foster a culture of continuous learning by encouraging team members to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices.
* Offer training and resources to help team members expand their knowledge and skills.
* Pair developers with subject matter experts to ensure thorough PR reviews and expedite the learning process.

### Insufficient Collaboration&#x20;

Poor communication or collaboration among team members may result in delays, confusion, or miscommunication, which can extend the PR cycle time.

#### Signs

* Poor communication among team members leads to confusion or misinterpretation during PR reviews.
* Siloed knowledge or lack of cross-functional collaboration.
* Unresolved disputes or disagreements during the review process.

#### Recommendations

* Implement tools and platforms that facilitate communication and collaboration among team members, such as chat applications or project management tools.
* Encourage regular team meetings and open discussions to address any issues or concerns related to PR reviews.
* Create a knowledge-sharing culture by encouraging team members to document and share their expertise with others.

### External Dependencies

If a PR depends on completing another task, approval from stakeholders, or input from external teams, it may take longer for the PR to be reviewed and merged, resulting in an increased cycle time.

#### Signs

* There are frequent delays in PR reviews due to waiting for input or approval from external parties.
* Unresolved dependencies cause PRs to be left unmerged for extended periods.
* Inefficient coordination with external teams or stakeholders.

#### Recommendations

* Clearly define dependencies early in the development process and set realistic timelines for their resolution.
* Maintain open communication with external stakeholders and teams to ensure timely input and approvals.
* Identify and mitigate potential bottlenecks in the PR review process caused by external dependencies.

By implementing these recommendations, development teams can address the causes of increased PR cycle times, leading to more efficient processes and improved overall performance.
