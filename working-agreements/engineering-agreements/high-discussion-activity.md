# ðŸ’¬ High Discussion Activity

## **Why?**

Monitoring high discussion activity on a PR (Pull Request) is important for several reasons:

1. **Early identification of issues:** High discussion activity can indicate that there are issues or disagreements within the PR that need to be resolved. Monitoring these discussions allows the team to address these concerns early, preventing potential delays or problems in the development process.
2. **Effective collaboration:** Keeping track of high discussion activity can ensure that all team members are on the same page and engaged in the conversation. This promotes collaboration, shared understanding, and helps to prevent misunderstandings or miscommunication.
3. **Efficient use of resources:** High discussion activity might signal that a PR is consuming a significant amount of the team's time and energy. Monitoring this activity allows managers to assess whether the PR is receiving the appropriate level of attention and make adjustments as needed to optimize resource allocation.
4. **Code quality and maintainability:** A high level of discussion on a PR can indicate potential issues with code quality, design, or architecture. By monitoring these discussions, the team can ensure that any concerns are addressed, resulting in higher quality and more maintainable code.
5. **Knowledge sharing:** Active discussions on PRs can serve as a valuable learning opportunity for team members, as they can gain insights from their peers' feedback and suggestions. Monitoring these discussions encourages knowledge sharing and helps team members learn from one another.
6. **Consensus building:** High discussion activity can help build consensus among team members regarding the best approach to implement a feature or fix a bug. By monitoring these discussions, the team can work together to find the best solution and minimize conflicts or disagreements.
7. **Continuous improvement:** Monitoring high discussion activity can reveal patterns or recurring issues within the team's development process. Identifying and addressing these issues can lead to continuous improvement, streamlining the development process, and enhancing overall team performance.

In summary, monitoring high discussion activity on PRs is essential for effective collaboration, resource allocation, code quality, knowledge sharing, and continuous improvement.

## Recommendations

Monitoring and addressing high discussion activity around a PR is essential for effective collaboration, resource allocation, code quality, knowledge sharing, and continuous improvement. Here we outline the potential causes of high discussion activity, their corresponding indicators, and possible solutions.

### **Lack of Clarity**

The PR is not well-documented or lacks sufficient context, leading to numerous questions or requests for clarification.

#### Signs

* Reviewers ask multiple questions about the PR's purpose or implementation.
* Frequent requests for clarification or more information.
* Incomplete or unclear PR descriptions.

#### Recommendations

* Ensure each PR includes a clear, concise description of its purpose and the changes being introduced.
* When necessary, provide additional context and documentation to support reviewers in understanding the PR.
* Address potential areas of confusion proactively by explaining complex or non-obvious code changes.

### &#x20;**Large or Complex Changes**

PRs with many changes or complex modifications may require more in-depth discussions and feedback, generating more comments.

#### Signs

* PRs containing many files or lines of code changed.
* Complex new features or architectural changes.
* Prolonged discussions about the best approach to solving a problem.

#### Recommendations

* Break down large or complex PRs into smaller, more manageable parts.
* Document and explain the rationale behind complex changes.
* Encourage focused discussions on specific aspects of the PR rather than broad debates.

### **Code Quality Issues**

The submitted code has multiple issues, such as poor coding practices, bugs, or suboptimal design decisions, leading to numerous comments addressing these concerns.

#### Signs

* Frequent comments pointing out code smells, bugs, or design flaws.
* Repeated requests for changes to improve code quality.
* Reviewers expressing concerns about the maintainability or reliability of the code.

#### Recommendations

* Encourage developers to review their own code before submitting a PR.
* Implement automated code quality checks, such as linters and static analyzers, to catch issues early.
* Foster a culture of continuous learning and improvement, emphasizing best practices and clean code.

### **Inconsistent Coding Standards**

The PR does not adhere to the established coding standards or style guidelines, leading to comments requesting changes to comply with agreed-upon conventions.

#### Signs

* Comments addressing formatting, naming conventions, or other style-related issues.
* Reviewers requesting changes to adhere to coding standards.
* Inconsistent code style within the PR.

#### Recommendations

* Implement automated tools, such as linters and formatters, to enforce coding standards consistently.
* Document and share the team's coding standards and style guidelines.
* Encourage developers to familiarize themselves with and follow these conventions.

### **Ambiguity in Requirements**

The requirements for the implemented feature or fix are ambiguous or open to interpretation, leading to differing opinions on the best approach and more comments and discussions.

#### Signs

* Conflicting opinions on how to implement a feature or fix a bug.
* Reviewers question the purpose or necessity of specific changes.
* Unclear or incomplete requirements documentation.

#### Recommendations

* Clearly define and document requirements before starting development.
* Encourage open communication and collaboration between developers, product managers, and other stakeholders to clarify requirements.
* Address any ambiguities or uncertainties in the requirements early in the development process

### **Lack of Communication or Collaboration**

Poor communication between team members may lead to misunderstandings or discrepancies in the PR, resulting in more comments as reviewers attempt to clarify and resolve issues.

#### Signs

* Misunderstandings or confusion among reviewers about the PR's purpose or implementation.
* Conflicting changes or feedback from different reviewers.
* Siloed knowledge or lack of cross-functional collaboration.

#### Recommendations

* Foster a culture of open communication and collaboration within the team.
* Use tools and platforms that facilitate communication and collaboration, such as chat applications or project management tools.
*   Encourage regular team meetings, stand-ups, or other opportunities for team members to share updates and ask questions.



### **Inexperienced Developers**

Developers who are new to the team or less experienced in the codebase or technology may submit PRs with more issues, requiring additional guidance and feedback from reviewers.

#### Signs

* Frequent comments providing guidance or suggestions for improvements.
* PRs submitted by new or inexperienced team members with more issues.
* Reviewers spend more time explaining concepts or best practices.

#### Recommendations

* Offer mentorship or pair programming opportunities for inexperienced developers.
* Encourage developers to ask for help or seek guidance from more experienced team members.
* Provide resources, such as documentation or training, to help developers improve their skills and understanding of the codebase and technology.

### **Multiple Reviewers**

When a PR has several reviewers, each reviewer may leave their own comments, resulting in a higher overall number of comments on the PR.

#### Signs

* Multiple reviewers left similar or overlapping comments.
* Lengthy discussions involving multiple participants.
* Conflicting or redundant feedback from different reviewers.

#### Recommendations

* Limit the number of reviewers for each PR to a manageable number, focusing on those with the most relevant expertise.
* To reduce redundancy and conflicting opinions, encourage reviewers to collaborate and discuss their feedback before leaving comments.
* Use a shared document or platform for reviewers to consolidate their feedback, so that the PR author can address comments more efficiently.

By implementing these recommendations, development teams can address the causes of High Discussion Activity, leading to more efficient processes and improved overall performance.
