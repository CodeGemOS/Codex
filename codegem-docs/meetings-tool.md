# ðŸ“… Meetings Tool

## Overview

Welcome to CodeGem's meeting tool! With this platform, you can effortlessly run different types of meetings to enhance collaboration, boost productivity, and streamline your workflow.&#x20;

CodeGem organizes meetings into collection and session. Each meeting you have is called a meeting session, and those sessions are grouped into collections for better organization.&#x20;

There are three types of collections in CodeGem,

* **Private Collections:** Private collections are only accessible to you and are an excellent way to organize your thoughts, plan your tasks, take private meeting notes, or schedule time for personal growth/reflection.
* **1:1 Collections:** This is a list of every ongoing 1:1 you have with your team.
* **Shared/Team Collections:** These meetings are accessible team-wide and can consist of Retrospectives, All-Hands, Sprint Planning, Stand Up meetings, and more. Try creating a Collection for each of these! ðŸ˜€

## Running Meetings in CodeGem

### Part 0: Setting up & scheduling Meeting

TLDR: Open up your [Meetings](https://my.codegem.app/meetings/) tab in CodeGem, click "+ New Collection" and choose which type of collection you'd like to create.

Meeting scheduled in CodeGem will show up directly in your calendar with a quick link back to your CodeGem document. In addition, for teams with Slack connected, CodeGem will send out a pre-meeting reminder that includes the agenda, any outstanding action items, and a link to access the notes.

If you're not ready to schedule a meeting in CodeGem, not to worry, you can still create and organize your meeting in advance by selecting this option in the collection creation menu.

<details>

<summary>How Do I Create and/or Schedule a Meeting in CodeGem?</summary>

1. Open up the [Meetings](https://my.codegem.app/meetings/) tab, click "+ New Collection" and choose which type of collection you'd like to create.
2. You can configure the following:
   * **Name: What would you like to call this collection** (1:1's are default named according to the participants)
   * **Participants:** Workspace members who should be invited & have access to the meeting notes\
     _\*\*\* Please note: the team members you choose here will be invited to every session of this meeting by default._
   * **Scheduling (Optional):**
     * Recurrence: Select the recurrence of the meeting, or choose one-time for one-off meetings
     * Date of Next Meeting
     * Time: What time of day the meeting will occur (based on the timezone of the creator)
     * Duration: How long will the meeting be
     * Send calendar invite? Yes or No (This can be changed later)
   * **Default Template:** This template will be automatically applied to future meetings

<!---->

3. Done! If you have chosen to send an invite, CodeGem will send a calendar invite to the collection participants with a link to your shared documents

</details>

**What about Adhoc Meetings?** You can also always create new ad-hoc sessions (document) for a collection, by clicking the "New Session" button

### Part 1: Preparing for the Meeting

For meeting scheduling in CodeGem, you will receive a pre-meeting reminder with the agenda and any outstanding action items, and a link to access the notes. We recommend reviewing and adding to the agenda in advance to make the most of everyone's time.

**Not sure what to talk about?**\
Take a look at CodeGem's templates for recommended talking points by clicking "Apply a template"

### Part 2: During the Meeting

If you don't have the document open already, you can access your meeting notes directly in the calendar invite. For virtual meeting, we recommend you push your meeting notes up onto a secondary screen split screen CodeGem with you video tool

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)

CodeGem's meeting notes are collaborative (similar to a Google doc), so all participants can take notes, create action items, and add talking points as the conversation progresses!

### Part 3: Wrapping up the Meeting

At the end of your meeting remember to add in any last notes and action items.

Once you've finished, hit the **finish meeting** button in the top right corner to file your meeting under the "completed" session section. For recurring meetings, this will automatically create your next session (with the default template ready to go!).

### :page\_with\_curl:  Meeting Templates

CodeGem has done extensive research and worked with top leaders to create effective templates for your meetings. Each collection type contains unique templates optimized for private, 1:1, and shared/team sessions.

<details>

<summary>How Do I Use Templates?</summary>

CodeGem has done extensive research and worked with leading engineering teams to create effective templates for your 1:1s. Here's how you can use these templates in your next 1:1s.

1.  Visit the [meetings page](https://my.codegem.app/meetings/codegem-101) or click on "Meetings" in the left-hand side navigation menu. Find the 1:1 collection you would like to use a template on. Click "view all templates".\


    _Note: If you don't see any existing 1:1s you will need to_ [_create_](https://intercom.help/codegem-support/en/articles/6204034-how-to-set-up-1-1s-with-your-team) _one, click "Create your first 1:1". You can also click " + New Collection" at the bottom of the screen._\

### ðŸ’…  1:1 Formatting in CodeGem

The formatting bar at the top of the page can be used for common styling of your agenda.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

There are two special elements located to the furtherst right; talking points and action items.

* The **square checkbox** is an action item. Action items live on your Home Page as well as your Action Item tray and can be reassigned, edited, or deleted.
* The **circular checkbox** is a talking point. You can check them off as you proceed through your meeting to stay on topic and on time.

**We also have several keyboard shortcuts that include:**

() to create a talking point.

\[] to create an action item

## Heading 1 ("#")

### Heading 2 ("##")

#### Heading 3 ("###")

**Heading 4 ("####")**

**Heading 5 ("#####")**

````
Inline Code (type "```" or "~~~" + Space)
````

**Creating Horizontal Dividers** (Type "---" on a new line)

### :chart\_with\_upwards\_trend:  Adding Data to Meetings

Check-ins, feedback, and analytics inside of CodeGem can (and should) be plugged into your 1:1s by embedding data right into the agenda. This allows you to quickly build agendas as you review the nudges and data within your CodeGem workspace.

For example, you can add...

<details>

<summary>ðŸ§ƒ Wellness Data</summary>

Including wellness data like the Tag Sentiment Chart or the Mood History Calendar (see below) can give you some incredible insight into where your team is feeling friction. Acknowledging concerns and recognizing highlights shared by your team members will help them feel heard and supported.

**For example:** Instead of asking your team how their week went, you can pull in the Mood History Calendar for the whole team or an individual.

</details>

<details>

<summary>ðŸŒ± Feedback, Kudos, &#x26; Wins Tables</summary>

These tables are the best way to include check-ins and feedback in your 1:1. Below is a table that features feedback from "Justin" but this table can be added to **any** session.

**For example:** One of Justin's feedback submissions was for "Lennie". As a manager, I want to echo the kudos that Justin is giving Lennie, so I would include that row of data in my 1:1 with Lennie to discuss it and show him that his efforts are being recognized.

</details>

<details>

<summary>ðŸ“Š Productivity Graphs</summary>

Isn't this the most beautiful thing you've ever seen? A graph _**inside**_ your agenda with the click of a button. No more pasting stats into a notepad. Now you can visually highlight the amazing work your developers do.

**How? Picture this:** In the below chart, it looks like our code review cycle time has increased significantly in the last few weeks (not good). Asking your reports questions like, _"how do you think we as a team can accelerate our code review process without compromising quality?_ , is a great way to identify bottlenecks.

For more information on what specific metrics mean and how you can use them properly, please hover over the question mark icon on each widget when viewed in the dashboard.
