# üñê Rollout Guide for Managers

1. Get Familiar with CodeGem
2. Plan your launch&#x20;
3. Get tactical

## Get Familiar with CodeGem Features&#x20;

Determine what features you want to start with.&#x20;

<details>

<summary>üìÖ  1:1 Meetings</summary>

Build a collection of recurring one-on-one meetings for each of your team members.

Use CodeGems collaborative agenda-building to discuss what matters, including feedback, blockers, goal setting, and important milestones.

Use action items to track and follow up on work. These action items will propagate to the next one-on-one until completion.&#x20;

<details>

<summary>üë•  Team Meetings</summary>

Build a collection of recurring team meetings with the Code Gem templates. Popular team meetings are Retro, Standup, and Weekly Leadership Sync.&#x20;

Use action items to track, assign, and follow up on work. These action items will propagate to the next meeting in the collection until they are complete.&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary>‚úÖ  Auomated Action Items</summary>

Use action items to track, assign, and follow up on work.&#x20;

Action items can be created directly in your meeting notes (Pro tip: Try using \[]!), and will be pushed forward until they are complete.

Action items overdue or due soon will be included in your daily health report from CodeGem as well as in pre-meeting reminders

</details>

<details>

<summary>üö¶  Red-Yellow- Green Light Check-Ins</summary>

Your team values your time. They won't share problems until they've escalated.&#x20;

CodeGem‚Äôs check-in gives your team a dedicated channel to communicate both lowlights and highlights so you can hear about challenges early and support them when they need it most.

Keep a pulse on your team's wellness trends and add check-in to your meetings so you can easily surface problems and discuss challenges.&#x20;

**Setup Needed**&#x20;

[Browser Extension](integrations/browser-extension/) and/or Slack. Checkins can also be done in the app, but we recommend using the [extension](integrations/browser-extension/) or SlackBot for easier access.&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary>üåü  Input - Kudos, Feedback, Wins, Support</summary>

CodeGem makes it easy for you and your team to share and keep track of in-the-flow feedback, kudos, and wins. CodeGem helps the team foster psychological safety by giving you and your team full control over who sees what.

Build a culture of growth and recognition, while streamlining your reviews. Avoid scrambling for data during performance reviews and let CodeGem keep track of everything you and your team need so that you‚Äôre prepared for the spotlight.

**Setup Needed**&#x20;

Chrome Extension and/or Slack. Checkins can also be done in the app, but we recommend using the Chrome extension or SlackBot for easier access.

</details>

<details>

<summary>üéØ  Working Agreements</summary>

Working agreements are codified best practices or guidelines you set and agree upon with your team to boost productivity, improve collaboration and support wellness. When a working agreement is broken CodeGem will generate an exception designed to promote discussion.

#### [Kudos & Feedback Agreements](../working-agreements/kudos-and-feedback-agreements/)

Enable one or more of the following Kudos & Feedback Agreements working agreements.&#x20;

* [No Feedback Shared](../working-agreements/kudos-and-feedback-agreements/no-feedback-shared.md)
* [No Kudos Shared](../working-agreements/kudos-and-feedback-agreements/no-kudos-shared.md)

#### [Engineering Agreements](../working-agreements/engineering-agreements/)

Enable one or more of the following engineering working agreements.&#x20;

* [Dev Work in Progress Limit](../working-agreements/engineering-agreements/dev-work-in-progress-limit.md)
* [High Discussion Activity](../working-agreements/engineering-agreements/high-discussion-activity.md)
* [Pull Request Cycle Time Limit.](../working-agreements/engineering-agreements/pull-request-cycle-time-limit.md)

GitHub integration is Needed.&#x20;

_We are constantly adding new working agreements. If there is a working agreement you would like to set up for your team, let us know!_

</details>

## Plan Your Launch&#x20;

At CodeGem, we recommend the early adopter's approach to rolling out new software. This means rolling out CodeGem in phases, one dev team at a time.&#x20;

1. Decide which features you will use. We recommend at a minimum you start with the following core set:
   * üìÖ  1:1 Meetings
   * üö¶  Red-Yellow- Green Light Check-Ins
   * üåü Kudos & Feedback
   * üéØ Working Agreements (Choose 1 to start)
2. Determine the team that will use CodeGem first. Pick a team and manager that are people-oriented and more open to change.
3. Introduce the team to CodeGem

<summary>Sample Welcome Message</summary>

**Subject: üíé Introducing CodeGem: Our New Collaboration Tool**

Hi team,

I'm excited to share that we'll be using CodeGem to help us work better together. It's designed to help me support you better.

CodeGem will be helping us.

* üìÖ  **Facilitate 1:1s**\
  Unlocks collaborative notes, automated action items, helpful reminders, and more!
* :heart: **Capture In-the-flow Check-ins**\
  A dedicated channel for us to share lowlights and highlights so can surface problems faster and support one another
* :hand\_splayed: **Share Feeback, Wins & Kudos**\
  We can easily share and keep track of in-the-moment wins, requests, feedback, and kudos (_Note: We can pull these into meetings and perf reviews to help highlight our success throughout the year!)_
* üë• **Collaborative Team Meetings**\
  Help us run product team meetings and agile rituals with effective templates, automated action items, and shared notes.
* **üå± Healthy Engineering Analytics**\
  These analytics are meant to promote discussion and help us highlight behind-the-scene efforts like code review while identifying bottlenecks and surfacing areas for improvement
* **üéØ Set Working Agreements**\
  Together we'll decide on team best practices we want to follow to build a healthy culture and CodeGem will help us make sure we're sticking to these

It's intuitive, easy to use, and will help us stay organized and work together seamlessly.
