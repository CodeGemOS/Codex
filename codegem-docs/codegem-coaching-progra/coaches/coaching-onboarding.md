Determine what features you want to start with.&#x20;

<details>

<summary>üë•  Group Coaching Session</summary>

CodeGem can help you run effective group coaching sessions - great for both teams or peer groups.

Share a collaborative agenda with the group, leverage leading templates, and assign action items to ensure your coaching session is productive and engaging.

</details>

<details>

<summary>‚úÖ  Auomated Action Items</summary>

Use action items to track, assign, and follow up on work.&#x20;

Action items can be created directly in your meeting notes (Pro tip: Try using \[]!), and will be pushed forward until they are complete.

Action items overdue or due soon will be included in your daily health report from CodeGem as well as in pre-meeting reminders

</details>

<details>

<summary>üö¶  Red-Yellow- Green Light Check-Ins</summary>

CodeGem‚Äôs check-in gives your clients a dedicated channel to communicate both lowlights and highlights so you can hear about challenges early and support them when they need it most.

Make it easy for your clients to surface and discuss challenges by easily adding check-ins to your meeting agenda.

**Setup Needed**&#x20;

[Browser Extension](../../integrations/browser-extension/) and/or Slack. Checkins can also be done in the app, but we recommend using the [extension](../../integrations/browser-extension/) or SlackBot for easier access.

</details>

<details>

<summary>üåü  Input - Kudos, Feedback, Wins, Support</summary>

CodeGem makes it easy for you to share and keep track of feedback, kudos and wins with your clients making it easy for you to show what value you have delivered over time.

Your clients also unlock the ability to share-in-the-flow requests, wins, feedback, and kudos.&#x20;

**Setup Needed**&#x20;

Chrome Extension and/or Slack. Checkins can also be done in the app, but we recommend using the Chrome extension or SlackBot for easier access.

</details>

<details>

<summary>üéØ  Working Agreements</summary>

Working agreements are codified best practices or guidelines you set with your clients to establish in order to improve collaboration and communication. When a working agreement is broken CodeGem will generate an exception designed to promote discussion.

#### [Kudos & Feedback Agreements](../../../working-agreements/kudos-and-feedback-agreements/)

Enable one or more of the following Kudos & Feedback Agreements working agreements.&#x20;

* [No Feedback Shared](../../../working-agreements/kudos-and-feedback-agreements/no-feedback-shared.md)
* [No Kudos Shared](../../../working-agreements/kudos-and-feedback-agreements/no-kudos-shared.md)

#### [Engineering Agreements](../../../working-agreements/engineering-agreements/)

Enable one or more of the following engineering working agreements.&#x20;

* [Dev Work in Progress Limit](../../../working-agreements/engineering-agreements/dev-work-in-progress-limit.md)
* [High Discussion Activity](../../../working-agreements/engineering-agreements/high-discussion-activity.md)
* [Pull Request Cycle Time Limit.](../../../working-agreements/engineering-agreements/pull-request-cycle-time-limit.md)

GitHub integration is Needed.&#x20;

_We are constantly adding new working agreements. If there is a working agreement you would like to set up for yourself, or for your clients let us know!_

## Customize Your Coaching Experience&#x20;

1. Decide which features you will use for coaching. We recommend at a minimum you start with the following core set:
   * 1-1 Coaching Sessions + Action Items
   * Slack Integration
   * Check-ins
   * Kudos & Feedback
2. Determine which clients you will be using CodeGem with. We recommend starting small and using CodeGem with a few clients who are more open to change to start, then expanding.
3. Communicate the change with the select client to introduce them to CodeGem
