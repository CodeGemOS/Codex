# 🤝 Client Intro Session

## Running an Effective Intro Session&#x20;

Your client intro session is a key conversation for you as a coach to build rapport with new potential clients, understand their needs, and showcase your value. Both you and the client will be looking to establish if this is a good fit in order to make an informed decision about moving forward with the coaching engagement.

### Preparing for the intro

Once a client applies to CodeGem's coaching program, we will match them with 1-3 recommended coaches. Once a client chooses to move forward with you, they will use your calendar link to book an intro session.

Before your session, we will share an overview of who you are meeting with, highlighting their personal background, current team/company, top-of-mind challenge, and coaching preferences.&#x20;

We recommend the following steps to ensure an effective intro:

* [ ] If you have not already done so, create a new collection in CodeGem called "intro sessions" with the default template, **💼 Coaching / Mentorship Intro**\
  **->** _For a detailed walk-through see:_ [**How to set up a meeting in CodeGem**](https://app.gitbook.com/o/0MrT9izX1EueK2ueiZyl/s/aRpCnHYleMn4ayiIvSeD/\~/changes/23/codegem-docs/meetings-tool#how-do-i-create-and-or-schedule-a-meeting-in-codegem)
* [ ] Create a new session and title it with the client's name.
* [ ] Schedule the meeting in CodeGem or Copy and paste the URL of the session to the existing calendar event (these notes are not shared with the client, so only you will have access to them)
* [ ] Review the client's background and add specific talking points and notes to the agenda that highlight alignment between your specialties and the challenges the client is facing

### During the Intro Session

* [ ] Open up your CodeGem Agenda and review it at least 5 minutes in advance.
* [ ] Take notes about key background information, challenges mentioned, or any other information that will help you better coach them in the future
* [ ] Record any action items and set due dates (Tip: use \[] as a shortcut to create action items)

<summary>📅  What should I focus on during my intro coaching session?</summary>

1. **Building Rapport:** The introductory session allows the coach to establish a rapport and build a relationship with the client. It provides an opportunity for both parties to get to know each other, ensuring there is a good fit between the coach and client in terms of communication style, personality, and coaching approach. Building rapport is crucial for fostering trust and creating a safe space for the client to open up and engage in the coaching process.
2. **Assessing Client's Needs:** The free intro session allows the coach to gain a deeper understanding of the client's needs, goals, and challenges. Through active listening and asking probing questions, the coach can gather relevant information to assess whether they have the expertise and resources to effectively support the client. It helps the coach determine if they are the right fit for the client and if they can provide value in addressing the client's specific coaching requirements.
3. **Clarifying Expectations:** The introductory session provides an opportunity to clarify the client's expectations and ensure alignment between the client's goals and the coach's capabilities. It allows the coach to communicate their coaching approach, methodologies, and the potential outcomes the client can expect. By setting clear expectations upfront, both the coach and client can avoid misunderstandings and ensure a smooth coaching journey.
4. **Showcasing Value:** The introductory session allows the coach to showcase their expertise and demonstrate the value they can provide to the client. By sharing relevant success stories, testimonials, or case studies, the coach can illustrate their track record of helping clients achieve their goals. It helps the client gain confidence in the coach's ability to support their growth and development.
5. **Establishing a Connection:** The free intro session provides an opportunity for the coach and client to connect on a personal level. It allows the client to assess the coach's demeanor, communication style, and level of empathy. Similarly, the coach can gauge the client's openness, commitment, and willingness to engage in the coaching process. This connection is vital for building trust and ensuring a strong coaching relationship moving forward.
6. **Decision Making:** The introductory session serves as a platform for the client to make an informed decision about whether they want to proceed with the coaching engagement. It allows the client to evaluate the coach's expertise, approach, and compatibility with their needs. Similarly, the coach can also assess if the client is a good fit for their coaching style and if they can effectively support the client in achieving their goals.
