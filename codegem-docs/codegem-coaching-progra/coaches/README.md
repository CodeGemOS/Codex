## :wave: Intro

CodeGem's Coaching Program is a premier coaching marketplace designed to connect experienced coaches like you with clients seeking personalized coaching in various areas of professional and personal development.

#### Why we starting the CodeGem's Coaching Program:

At CodeGem, **we are obsessed with helping managers improve.** We give leaders the missing tools they need to ensure their team is productive and engaged for the long term. And we bring them all together, in one place.

But equipping leaders with the right tools only works if they know how to use them, and today most leaders transition into leadership with no training. We work with tons of leaders looking for support and we want to match them with the right coach at the right time.
