# ü§ù Running a Effective Coaching Session

## Intro&#x20;

Your coaching session is a crucial opportunity to support your clients in their growth and development. Follow these steps to ensure an effective coaching session:

### Preparing for the Session

Whether meeting a client for the 2nd or 17th time, it's important to go into your coaching session prepared and ready to deliver value.

We recommend the following steps to ensure you're setup for success:

* [ ] If you have not already done so, ensure your next session in CodeGem is set up.\
  _For recurring meetings, hit "finish meeting" to automatically set up your next session._\
  _For ad-hoc meetings, hit "+ new session" button_
* [ ] Review previous sessions and familiarize yourself with your client's background info
* [ ] Leverage CodeGem templates and prepare the session agenda based on the client's objectives and desired outcomes.

### During the Coaching Session

* [ ] **Open up your CodeGem Agenda** and review it at least 5 minutes in advance.
* [ ] **Take notes** about key background information, challenges mentioned, or any other information that will help you better coach them in the future
* [ ] **Record any action items** and set due dates (Tip: use \[] as a shortcut to create action items)
* [ ] At the end of your coaching session, **make sure to talk about/confirm the next time you meet**\
  For ad-hoc coaching, if it makes sense, this is a good time to recommend and discuss the benefits of moving to a monthly coaching package

1. Setting the Stage:
   * Start the session by creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. Begin with a brief check-in to understand the client's current state and any updates since the last session.
   * Revisit the agenda and confirm the focus areas for the session. Ensure alignment between the client's expectations and the planned discussion points.
2. Action Items, Goal Progress, and Accountability:
   * Review the client's progress toward their goals and action items since the previous session. Celebrate achievements and acknowledge their efforts.
   * Discuss any obstacles or challenges they encountered and support them in finding strategies to overcome them.
   * Encourage the client to take ownership of their actions and commitments, ensuring accountability and progress towards their desired outcomes.
3. Active Listening and Powerful Questions:
   * Practice active listening to deeply understand the client's thoughts, emotions, and challenges. Demonstrate empathy and create a safe space for open dialogue.
   * Utilize powerful questioning techniques to facilitate self-reflection, explore underlying beliefs, and encourage new perspectives.
   * Encourage the client to express their thoughts and feelings fully, allowing them to explore their experiences and gain insights.
4. Providing Support and Insights:
   * Offer guidance, insights, and tools that align with the client's goals and challenges. Share resources, relevant experiences, or frameworks to facilitate their growth.
   * Provide constructive feedback to help the client gain new perspectives and enhance their skills and awareness.
   * Offer alternative strategies or approaches that may empower the client to address their challenges effectively.
5. Action Planning:
   * Collaborate with the client to develop an action plan based on the insights gained during the session. Set specific tasks, milestones, and timelines to support their progress.
   * Help the client identify potential obstacles or risks and develop contingency plans to stay on track.
   * Clarify the client's commitment to implementing the action plan and discuss any support they may need in between sessions.
6. Closing the Session:
   * Summarize the key takeaways and insights from the session. Ensure the client has a clear understanding of the next steps and action items.
   * Check if there are any additional questions or concerns the client would like to address before concluding the session.
   * Express appreciation for their openness, effort, and commitment to the coaching process.
7. Follow-up:
   * Send a follow-up email to express gratitude for the client's participation and reiterate key points discussed during the session.
   * If applicable, provide pricing information or next steps for continued coaching engagement.
   * Update the session notes in CodeGem, recording action items, milestones, and any important reflections from the session.

Remember to adapt these steps based on the client's specific needs and coaching arrangement. Stay flexible, listen actively, and provide the necessary support and guidance to help your clients thrive.
