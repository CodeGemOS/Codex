# ü§ù Engaging with A Client

## Defining the Engagement&#x20;

Most coaches will offer 3 primary types of engagements:

1. Per-Session Coaching
2. Monthly Package
3. Team Workshops

The below guides will help you get set up for each type of engagement

<details>

<summary><strong>Not sure where to start?</strong></summary>

_If your client has not chosen which type of engagement they would like, based on the intro session recommend a plan that best suits their needs. In general, we recommend starting out with per-session coaching as it's a great way to deliver and build trust without a high upfront commitment/cost._

</details>

## (1) Setting up Session-by-Session Coaching

Clients will purchase a coaching session via your Stripe page. Once they've purchased a session, they can use your calendar link to book time.

Once your client has scheduled a session, make sure they're set up in your CodeGem workspace,

* [ ] If you've chosen to connect your Slack Coaching Channel to CodeGem, **invite your client to Slack**
* [ ] **Create a new 1:1 Collection in CodeGem with your client**\
  Adhoc sessions will likely be scheduled via your calendar link. If this is the case, make sure to check off the option to n[ot send a calendar invite\
  We also re](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]commend choosing the **üíº Coaching / Mentorship** default template
* [ ] Once the collection is created, your first session will be automatically populated. Make sure to **copy the session URL and paste it into your calendar invite**

<details>

<summary>All done! To make the most of your session-by-session ccoaching...</summary>

* Establish a structured session agenda and goals in collaboration with the client.
* Utilize active listening and powerful questioning techniques to help the client explore their challenges, goals, and potential solutions.
* Provide guidance, insights, and strategies tailored to the client's specific needs and objectives.
* Support the client in developing action plans and setting measurable goals between sessions.
* Offer accountability and follow-up on the client's progress, providing feedback and adjustments as necessary.

</details>

## (2) Setting Up a Monthly Package

Once your client has decided to subscribe to your monthly package, here's what you'll need to work out:

1. Based on the number of hours you've allocated to the selected monthly plan, would you like to meet weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly, and for how long? (We recommend, bi-weekly for 1 hour)
2. What day and time would you both like to meet?

Next, set up your clients in your coaching workspace,

* [ ] If you've chosen to connect your Slack Coaching Channel to CodeGem, invite your client to Slack and create a direct message/private channel for ongoing support and quick feedback. (if offered as part of the plan)
* [ ] Create a new 1:1 Collection in CodeGem with your client and schedule your recurring coaching meetings with the client based on the agreed-upon frequency (e.g., weekly or biweekly). (by completing this step, your client will be automatically invited to your workspace)\

## (3) Setting up Team/Group Coaching

Clients will purchase a group coaching session via your Stripe page. Once they've purchased a session, they can use your calendar link to book time.

Make sure you have the following:

* A list of participants and emails (this should be available in the calendar invitee list)
* A core subject for the workshop/session

Next, set up your workshop in your coaching workspace,

* [ ] If you've chosen to connect your Slack Coaching Channel to CodeGem, **invite the participants to Slack.**
* [ ] **Create a new Team/Shared Collection in CodeGem**\
  Team sessions will likely be scheduled via your calendar link. If this is the case, make sure to check off the option to n[ot send a calendar invite](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]
* [ ] Once the collection is created, choose a template for your workshop or start building out your team workshop agenda\
  _If you would like support creating a workshop agenda, the CodeGem team is happy to help!_
* [ ] Once you are happy with your agenda, open up your collection setting and add the workshop participants in
