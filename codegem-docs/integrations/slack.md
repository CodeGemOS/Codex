</details>

_Note: You must be a Slack and CodeGem admin to do this._ \
\
Once this has been completed, others in your CodeGem workspace can:

* Use CodeGems's `/codegem` commands to complete check-ins or share feedback and kudos directly in Slack
* Receive important reminders about upcoming meetings, due actions items, or working agreement exceptions via. Slack
* Schedule and complete team Rituals like daily standup in Slack

## User Account Connection

In order to keep track of data and share reminders, CodeGem needs to match each users Slack Account to their CodeGem account correctly. There are 3 ways to do so:

#### **Option 1:** Auto-Match Slack & CodeGem account

If Slack is installed prior and a new user is invited to CodeGem, CodeGem will automatically connect this user's CodeGem account to their Slack account based on the email. The email must be the same for both accounts.

#### **Option 2: Admin Manually Match Account**

Admins can open [User Management](https://my.codegem.app/settings/members) and manually connect each CodeGem user to their respective Slack account\

#### **Option 3: User Connects Account**

Once invited to CodeGem, users can also open up CodeGem app for Slack and click the connect button in the home tab\

## Inviting Guest Users From Slack

What if a user wants to share kudos with someone who's not in CodeGem? Not to worry, CodeGem's app for Slack will now let users invite teammates to CodeGem as guest users directly from Slack! (Guest users are free users with restricted visibility to data & limited usage)

## Basics

### :vertical\_traffic\_light:Check-ins

`/check-in` lets users quickly check-in and provide status updates without disrupting their flow.\
\
_CodeGem's check-ins give your team a dedicated channel to easily flag status updates throughout the day using colorful lights‚Äîüü¢ green for smooth sailing, üü° yellow for caution, and üî¥ red for "Houston, we have a problem". Support your team when they need it most, and nip problems in the bud._

### ‚≠êÔ∏è Kudos

`/kudos` Spread the love, appreciation, and good vibes with our Kudos command. \
\
_Whether someone saved the day or cracked a joke that made your coffee come out of your nose, give them a virtual high-five and watch the smiles light up the Slack channels. You deserve a round of applause too, so go ahead and give yourself a kudo while you're at it! üôå_

### üå± Feedback

`/check-in` lets users share and keep of feedback with teammates

_With this command, it's easy for you to give in-the-flow coaching while encouraging peer feedback across the team._

### Rituals

Once a team has set up their rituals in [Setting > Rituals](https://my.codegem.app/settings/rituals) users with Slack connected can complete these rituals directly in Slack!

*   At the scheduled time, users will receive a message from CodeGem with a CTA button\

* By clicking the CTA button user can fill out a short form and hit submit\

### Notifications

Once users have connected their CodeGem account to their Slack account, CodeGem's notification will automatically be delivered in Slack (instead of via. email). This includes,&#x20;

#### üìÖ Pre-Meeting Reminders

When you schedule a meeting in CodeGem, you will receive a reminder 15-min before your meeting with the agenda & quick access buttons. It's like having a personal assistant keeping you on top of your game!

#### üìÖ  Daily Health Report

Daily reports are short digests of important info including your action items and working agreement help. This will help you prepare for the workday by prioritizing your tasks and potential issues.

#### üìÖ Check-ins, Feedback & Kudos

When check-ins, feedback or kudos are shared notifications will be delivered in Slack depending on the sharing permission selected. When the `team` option is selected, the message will be shared in the configured team channel. When the `manger` or `manager + recipient` options are select, the message will be delivered to the designated user's DMs from CodeGem.
