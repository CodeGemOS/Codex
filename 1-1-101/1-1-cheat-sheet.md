# ⭐ 1:1 Cheat Sheet

#### It’s OK to cancel.

“If there’s nothing to discuss, it’s ok to cancel. People, too often, view 1:1s as mandatory, but it’s refreshing when you both acknowledge that things are ok for now, or the time may be better spent other ways… and you can do this as long as you both agree not to take a request to cancel personally.” – Ben Saitz, Chief Customer Officer at RocketFuel. Cancel occasionally, when you both agree, but beware not to do this regularly. See _Have Them_ above.
