## Why? Are 1:1 worth the time?

<details>

<summary>1.5 hours is so much! I don't believe you...</summary>

* [Gallup has found](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236450/managers-millennials-feedback-won-ask.aspx) that engagement is highest among employees who meet with their managers at least once a week, and employees whose managers hold regular meetings with them are almost 3x more likely to be engaged.

1:1 meetings are crucial for employee and team performance. They provide an opportunity for managers to check on employees‚Äô progress, offer help with projects, address challenges, give praise, and otherwise help employees solve problems. [Rachel Ben Hamou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rbh/), co-founder of workplace consultancy PeopleStorming, defines a 1:1 as ‚Äúa meeting between two people where one of them has a duty of care towards the other person's growth, well-being, and performance.‚Äù

If your team is following industry best practices, they're investing up to 1.5 hours/person each week into 1:1s. Is it worth the time? Yes. Absolutely.

But taking the time and making good use of the time are not the same things. CodeGem gives you the 1:1 tool you need to make the most out of every 1:1.



There‚Äôs broad consensus that the 1:1 is one of, if not _the_, most important meeting you can have.



1:1 is your most important meeting as a manager; and to run them effectively **you need a system.**&#x20;

## What?

**Types of 1:1s**

* Direct Report
* Skip-Level
*   Skip level meetings are 1:1s that managers hold with staff other than the people they manage directly - usually they are between a senior manager and the direct reports of the people they manage.

    They‚Äôre a great way to improve communication and the flow of information within a company. Managers get a sense of what is happening on the front lines and employees get a better sense of larger company objectives. It is a great opportunity for managers to build trust with employees and ensure that they‚Äôre feeling engaged and valued.

    CodeGem has a [template](https://intercom.help/codegem-support/en/articles/6216562-how-do-i-use-1-1-templates) you can use to hold skip level meetings at your company.

* Peer 1:1s
* Don‚Äôt forget that you can also have 1:1s with coworkers other than your manager or report. If you frequently work with someone or have a mentor, consider sitting together once a month. 1:1s can help in many ways.\

Who Own the Agenda:

*   #### 1:1s are a joint responsibility

    While managers are typically responsible for setting and sticking to the cadence of 1:1s, both participants should be able to contribute to the agenda. Business leaders like Ben Horowitz and [Kim Scott ](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/effective-one-on-ones/)even recommend that employees rather than managers should own and drive their 1:1s.\
    If you as a manager feel like the responsibility of driving the 1:1 would be daunting for your team members, get them started with sharing talking points beforehand as a first step. Team members can still take more ownership as your relationship grows and 1:1s become a no-brainer.



1:1, one-on-one, 1-on-1.



1:1s are quiet, focused collaboration time for employees and bosses to connect. It‚Äôs also the most important chance for you to hear from your employee, and it‚Äôs their time, not yours. As a senior or junior manager, you must create the space for this.



Ben Horowitz accurately [describes 1:1 meetings](https://a16z.com/2012/08/30/one-on-one/) as the "free-form meeting for all the pressing issues, brilliant ideas, and chronic frustrations that do not fit neatly into status reports, email and other less personal and intimate mechanisms."

**So what is a 1:1?**

* **Relationship building**, creating an atmosphere of trust between you and your team, where it‚Äôs clear that you care personally about them
* **Feedback giving and receiving**, so people understand how they're performing and their areas of growth. This goes for you as well - if you're not getting feedback, then elicit it!
* **Information sharing, especially highlighting the status of immediate goals**. Most of this can be pre-written (and even pre-read) to save time.
* **Top tasks accountability**, ensuring that people do what they have committed to doing by being an accountability partner (rather than a micro-manager).
* Career growth, talking through people's aspirations and helping them get there



* Staying informed and aligned
* And as a manager, 1:1s help you improve retention and resolve issues before they become problems.
* Addressing topics prone to getting lost in the shuffle\
  The agenda of a 1:1 depends on your needs and can change from meeting to meeting. But ask yourself, ‚ÄúWhat are the most important things we should discuss today? And are there any roadblocks or ways how we can better support each other?‚Äù For managers driving the meeting, here are some [tips on what questions to ask.](https://www.small-improvements.com/blog/24-questions-ask-next-11-meeting/)
* Foster Trust build a trusting relationship. \
  So if it feels natural to you, don‚Äôt hesitate to also chat about private things for a bit.
  * psychological safety\
    The first point, building a trusting relationship, is a unique opportunity that 1:1 meetings offer. Regular personal conversations help both parties get to know each other better and build mutual trust. And that trust is what encourages open communication, honest feedback, and effective collaboration.
* Goal Checkin: Alignment, Progress,&#x20;
  * Boost Alignment, typing individual to orginizational goals
  * While I don‚Äôt recommend using a 1:1 for simple work status updates (those can easily be accomplished via email), it is entirely appropriate to include ‚ÄúProgress toward goals‚Äù as a standing agenda item in a 1:1. Your team member has quarterly goals ‚Äì ie KPIs or OKRs ‚Äì that are closely tied to the goals of the team and the company, and it‚Äôs very productive to understand the results that your team member is achieving. In the spirit, though, of allowing the employee to own the agenda, give him or her the autonomy to tee up the discussion and prioritize the specific items to cover. That week might be all good news, or maybe that week there‚Äôs a blocker that he she needs help with. Perhaps the employee just wants some advice on a problem they are working through. Be there to support them in the achievement of their goals and enable them to determine how you do that.
*   Career Development\
    As an employee, 1:1 meetings are a great way to stay in the driver‚Äôs seat of your career.\
    We have developed a very robust [Career Conversation methodology](https://www.radicalcandor.com/problem-career-conversations/) here (more on it in later posts). Once a Career Action Plan is developed, allow space in the 1:1 to talk about and follow up on action items. Making this a habit like brushing and flossing will mean that you are investing in your folks in a differentiated way. Kevin Sheridan says in his LinkedIn post about the [Top 3 Reasons Employees Quit](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/top-three-reasons-employees-quit-kevin-sheridan), ‚Äú\[Managers] do not regularly meet with their direct reports to discuss Career Development, Learning, and Promotion Opportunities.‚Äù Regular investment in growth and development helps everyone ‚Äì helps your employee grow towards their dreams, helps the team and company improve, and it helps your relationship with your employee.


* Providing mutual feedback to help each other grow
*   Get Feedback\
    The 1:1 is not the place for the manager to _give_ feedback to the employee. That‚Äôs not a typo. Recall that we favor short bursts ‚Äì a few minutes ‚Äì of feedback given [immediately](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/video-tip-radically-candid-criticism-immediate/) after the specific situation or event.

    Instead think about the 1:1 as a chance to _get_ feedback from your employees. If you want to build a culture of feedback, the best place to start is here. Follow [our steps to get people to open up](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/get-feedback/) and prove you can take and that you value tough feedback: ask your go-to question, stay silent until your employee has the chance to answer, listen with the intent to understand not to cross-examine, and then reward the candor.

    My co-founder, Kim, uses another approach, which can substitute or complement the above. She asks her direct reports to structure their 1:1 agendas by answering these questions:

    1. What‚Äôs on your mind this week?
    2. How happy were you this past week?
    3. How productive were you this past week?
    4. What feedback do you have for me?

    For the record, Ben, quoted above, also favors an open-ended question style for his 1:1s. Questions are a great way to help guide your employee‚Äôs thinking about the 1:1 agenda. But, I‚Äôve found that when working with more senior employees, it also works well to leave it entirely up to them and trust that they‚Äôll prioritize the appropriate agenda items.

    So remember, supercharge your 1:1s with your employees by making sure you have them, using the time to listen and learn what is important to your employee, and giving your employee ownership of the agenda (with some guidance on key topics to cover).

    \

* Coaching: coach each employee on an individual basis
  * Problem Solving
  * Support for Projects
* Recognition: give praise, address challenges, and help employees problem-solve
* Encouraging your  report to talk about their well-being;
* Highlighting employee achievements;
* Identifying roadblocks and brainstorming solutions;
* Giving bidirectional feedback (from manager to employee, and vice-versa);
* Asking about employee needs; experience in the team
* Giving employees space to share goals (for career planning or future projects within the company);
* Emphasizing team priorities;
* Reviewing lessons learned during the week;
* Planning for vacations or time off if needed.



Effective one-on-ones are like immune systems for companies. They‚Äôre critical for bubbling up and resolving issues that could otherwise spiral out of control. They‚Äôre also crucial in giving feedback to people so everyone is clear on how they‚Äôre performing.



What is a 1:1 not?

* Status Updates\* - Standup, Sprint Planning, Project Meeting.. there are&#x20;



**Who owns the agenda?**

Short Answer: you both do! That said a 1:1 is **their space** so any change you make to the agenda need to focus on the prinipals dirivng the conversaion.

* An example of something that you might request is a regular update on their OKRs, KPIs, etc., and maybe you‚Äôll ask that they communicate any blockers that you might be able to help with. Not crazy.



What makes a good 1:1

* organized
* frequent
* target meaningful topics
